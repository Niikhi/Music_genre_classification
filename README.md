# Music_genre_classification
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify music genres. It utilizes audio feature extraction techniques to analyze music samples, including chroma, RMS, spectral centroid, and MFCCs. These features are employed to train classification algorithms, enabling accurate prediction of music genre from audio data
